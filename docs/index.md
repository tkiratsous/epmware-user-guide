# EPMware User Guide

Welcome to the **EPMware User Guide**. EPMware is a master data management and workflow tool that manages master data and enforces your organization's workflow around the everyday processes that surround your metadata changes.

By configuring shared dimensions in EPMware, users request metadata once and our workflow engine routes the request to obtain approvals and deploys the metadata to the participating target systems. This allows standardization and rationalization of your metadata to evolve as your organization develops its master data strategy.

## Key Features

### Workflow Management
The EPMware dashboard allows users, managers, and application administrators to monitor the status of metadata requests in real time. Follow a request from the initial Create stage through its Review, Approve and Deploy stages. A graphical representation of each request's status in the workflow allows users to identify any bottlenecks in the metadata request process and determine if an escalation is required.

### Seamless Integration
Seamless integration to Oracle Cloud EPM, Oracle Fusion, Oracle EBS,Classic Hyperion Financial Management (HFM), Classic Essbase, Classic Planning applications and OneStream Software allows EPMware to deploy metadata without manual intervention or file manipulation from an administrator. Approved metadata is automatically deployed or scheduled for deployment using our built-in scheduler.

### Metadata Visualization
One-click import of your target system hierarchies allows users to clearly visualize how metadata will appear in their production environments. A configurable security module integrates with your current LDAP or Microsoft Active Directory (MSAD).

### Dynamic Workflows
Build, maintain and scale task driven workflows. Administrators model, build and maintain fully dynamic and scalable workflows using the Workflow Builder™. By using a combination of stages and tasks, Workflow Builder™ enables creation of any number of workflows that visually define your organization's business process, and then enforces it.

The Workflow Builder™ includes reusable workflow tasks, rule based validations, exception handling, email notifications for all workflow stages, custom functions and scripting for limitless customizations.

### Centralized Deployment Management
Centrally manage metadata deployments using the EPMware deployment module. It manages how and when metadata requests are deployed. Load metadata on demand or schedule a batch to run during off hours. Deployment metrics for all your EPM applications are on one page. Monitor in real time as "one time" or batches are deployed to their respective target applications. Create a recurring calendar for daily, weekly or monthly metadata deployments.

### Complete Audit Trail
Audit reports log every transaction, sign-off and deployment. EPMware maintains a complete audit trail of all transactions from request to deployment. Every transaction can be queried using reports included in the Audit module.
